            <p class='text-justify'> The NSVKI is the cooperation for
                Study Associations for Artificial Intelligence in the
                Netherlands.  The members VIA (Amsterdam), STORM (Amsterdam),
                Cover (Groningen), CognAC (Nijmegen) and USCKI Incognito
                (Utrecht) decided it to be a good idea to keep in contact in
                this form.  Our aim is to support Dutch AI students, and foster
                ties between students in all of the Netherlands. <br><br>

                       <p> <strong> CognAC </strong> is the study association of the Artificial Intelligence (AI)
		       	    program at the Radboud University Nijmegen. CognAC has been founded in 1990 
			    by students with the goal to improve the contacts between students and
                            its teachers. In short CognAC stands for ‘Cognitiewetenschappen Activiteiten Commissie’ 
			    (Cognitive Sciences Activities Committee). Our study association is related to our study:
			    AI, and thus has a strong focus on study-related activities, 
			    but a lot of activities are also very fun. </p>

			<p> At the moment CognAC has more than 400 members of which most are attending a the bachelor study 			       of Artificial Intelligence at the Radboud University at Nijmegen. However, CognAC also focusesits activities for members that are following the master study of Artificial Intelligence in Nijmegen (either with specialization in Cognitive Computing or Intelligent Technology). For both specializations Radboud University offers the possibility to finish with a double master. More information about the master study and the possibility for the double master you can find here:  <a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/artificial-intelligence/">https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/artificial-intelligence/</a>. </p>

			<p> CognAC offers the opportunity for everyone to socialize or learn something extra next to their 			       study. We organize activities almost every week. Some examples for our bigger activities are t				  he yearly Symposium or the League of Legends tournament.
